% Please use the following STRICT format:
%
% @type{key,
%	title = "...",
%	abstract = "...",
%	author = "...",
%	year = "",
%	month = ,
%	day = "",
%	language = "English",
%	doi = "",
%	url = "",
%	pdf = "",
% }
%
% 1. For the key use the last name of the first author followed by the
%    year, a colon, and the acronym of the venue, all in lowercase,
%    e.g.: "lazovik2000:ictai".
% 2. For author and editor use the format "A. Lazovik and E. Lazovik".
% 3. The doi, url, and pdf fields are optional but adviced. For url,
%    use the research.rug.nl link unless otherwise provided.
% 4. The month and day fields are optional but adviced because they
%    are used to order our publications. Ordering happens by year,
%    then type, month, day, author. Entries without the month field
%    will appear below those with a month field. The same holds for
%    the day field.
% 5. The month field must be either a number, a lowercase three
%    letter month code, or a capitalized month WITHOUT quotation
%    marks, e.g.: 3 or mar or March.
% 6. Use all other required fields for the type of publication.
% 7. UTF-8 is supported, as well as SOME LaTeX escaped characters,
%    e.g.: G{\"a}rtner or Gärtner.
% 8. In case two group members co-author a publication and each
%    include it in their bib file, they MUST use the same entry with
%    the same EXACT key.
