abstract = "This article focuses on developing both statistical and machine learning approaches for forecasting hourly electricity demand in Ontario. The novelties of this study include (i) identifying essential factors that have a significant effect on electricity consumption, (ii) the execution of a Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to optimize the model hyperparameters, (iii) hybridizing the BOA with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous inputs (SARIMAX) and nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous input (NARX) for modeling separately short-term electricity demand for the first time, (iv) comparing the model’s performance using several performance indicators and computing efficiency, and (v) validation of the model performance using unseen data. Six features (viz., snow depth, cloud cover, precipitation, temperature, irradiance toa, and irradiance surface) were found to be significant. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of five consecutive weekdays for all seasons in the hybrid BOA-NARX is obtained at about 3%, while a remarkable variation is observed in the hybrid BOA-SARIMAX. BOA-NARX provides an overall steady Relative Error (RE) in all seasons (1~6.56%), while BOA-SARIMAX provides unstable results (Fall: 0.73~2.98%; Summer: 8.41~14.44%). The coefficient of determination (R2) values for both models are >0.96. Overall results indicate that both models perform well; however, the hybrid BOA-NARX reveals a stable ability to handle the day-ahead electricity load forecasts.",

Particularly in education, digital twins offer interactive and comprehensive learning experiences. This paper explores the benefits of integrating digital twin technology into classroom settings and proposes a proof-of-concept application suitable for both in-person and online learning environments. The application aims to enhance student engagement by providing interactive tutorials and experiments with the ability to replay digital twin simulations. By offering real-time data observation alongside simulation-based learning, the application enriches the learning experience. Moreover, the paper also provides a brief literature review on the topic of digital twins in smart classrooms.",

This paper aims to present data mining models using classification methods based on Decision Trees (DT) algorithms to predict students' academic achievement after preparatory year, and to identify the algorithm that yields best performance. The students' academic achievement is defined as High, Average, or Below Average based on graduation CGPA. Three classifiers (J48, Random Tree and REPTree) are applied on a newly created dataset consisting of 339 students and 15 features, at the College of Computer Science and Information Technology (CCSIT). The outcome showed the J48 algorithm had an overall superior performance compared to other algorithms. Feature selection algorithms were used to reduce the feature vectors from 15 to 4 resulting in improvements in performance and computational efficiency. Finally, the results obtained help to pinpoint the preparatory year courses that impact graduation CGPA. Timely warnings, and preemptive counseling towards improving academic achievement is possible now.",

This tool is widely used for the diagnosis of complex systems for the early analysis of structural detectability and isolability of faults. The contribution of this paper is twofold: different points such as faults representation or how to handle differential variables are clarified. It is then shown how different levels of knowledge about faults can be incorporated in a structural fault isolability analysis and how they result in different isolability properties. The results are evaluated on a valve model that constitutes a benchmark for the European DAMADICS1 Research and Training network. It is also shown how to determine which faults in a system need further modelling investigation to get desired isolability properties.",

abstract = "Purpose: This study aims to investigate how a very particular learning environment, namely, partition rooms, affect students’ teaching experience and further explore if students’ learning styles is a pertinent determinant. Partition rooms are very common in Saudi Arabia when lectures are held by male instructors for female students. The male instructor delivers his lesson behind a glass wall, creating an environment of limited visual and auditory interaction. Various digital tools are present, meant to overcome the gap caused by the lack of direct student–teacher contact. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers collected data from a sample of 109 female students who are studying at Level 4 Computer Science Department, College of Computer Sciences and Information Technology, at a public university in Saudi Arabia. All of them experienced a minimum of two courses undertaken in a partition room. The survey consists of two parts with a total of 53 questions. The first 20 questions were adopted from the perceptual learning style preference questionnaire (PLSP). Findings: Research findings reveal that students are affected differently by the various dimensions of the partition room depending on their learning style. Originality/value: There are fewer results in the literature that study learners of our particular group, namely, Saudi females. The study focuses on students studying IT and related fields. This study is almost unique, as most studies of the kind are related to the experience of females learning English as a foreign language. Therefore, the authors’ research gives much-needed insight into the conditions and perceptions of female students studying toward their degree in a technical field.",

Digital hardware is one of the first courses in a typical Computer Science curriculum where students need to master these skills while analyzing and designing sequential circuits. This study investigates the pedagogical effectiveness of the Design Thinking methodology in improving students' higherorder cognitive skills in the digital hardware course. Design Thinking was embedded in the digital hardware course through a real-world design challenge where teams of students iteratively collaborated. The design problem was purposely set to necessitate knowledge and skills yet to be covered hence fostering in students' curiosity and eagerness to learn new topics, thus engaging students as active learners and meaning creators. The study demonstrates a significant gain in test scores. It also describes how to easily embed the Design Thinking process in the digital hardware curriculum.",

abstract = "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, like many other Gulf Council Countries, is lately experiencing a very rapid population and industrial growth, which results in an increasing demand for energy. To meet this growing demand, the GCC too is transitioning towards a smarter electricity grid with increased penetration of renewable sources. However, all agree that the success of such a shift in paradigm also depends on demand side management, most of energy demands coming for residential area. Providing residents with real-time feedback on their energy consumption is a promising way to promote energy saving behavior through an increased awareness. This paper outlines the design and development phases of a residential energy monitoring system that has been tailored to meet local needs, that is to say a non-intrusive system with a user friendly interface available both in English and Arabic endowed with an alert system providing real-time consumption information, as well as energy saving and awareness tips.",
