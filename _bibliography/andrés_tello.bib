However, there is no one-size-fits-all formula for publishing data as Linked Data. Also, the quality of linked data published is a key issue to take into account. In the library domain, the quality of linked data is a crucial point for improving the retrieval and use of the data. In this paper, we propose a set of methodological guidelines based on five activities for publishing library data as Linked Data. The proposed guidelines consider the quality of published data as a key issue. In this line, our approach includes a preprocessing task for data cleansing and normalization. The proposed approach has been applied in a use case for publishing bibliographic data from Open Access journals in Cuba. The results obtained show the applicability of the methodological guidelines proposed in a real environment.",

However, some of these conventional approaches lead to accuracy overestimation. In particular, sliding windows for data segmentation followed by standard random k-fold cross validation, produce biased results. An analysis of previous literature and present-day studies, surprisingly, shows that these are common approaches in state-of-the-art studies on HAR. It is important to raise awareness in the scientific community about this problem, whose negative effects are being overlooked. Otherwise, publications of biased results lead to papers that report lower accuracies, with correct unbiased methods, harder to publish. Several experiments with different types of datasets and different types of classification models allow us to exhibit the problem and show it persists independently of the method or dataset.",

The rapid proliferation of smartphones has led to many IPSs that utilize positioning technologies that are readily available on modern smartphones; including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).Using radio signals such as BLE in indoor environments comes with a number of challenges that can limit the reliability of the signal. In dealing with these challenges, most existing BLE-based IPSs introduce undesired drawbacks such as an extensive and fragile calibration phase, strict hardware requirements, and increases in the system's complexity. In this paper, an IPS is developed and evaluated that requires minimal setup for indoor environments and has a sufficiently low complexity to be run locally on a modern smartphone. An extensive exploration of the IPS' parameters was performed. The best performing parameter combinations resulted in a median positioning error of 1.48 ± 0.283 meters, while using the log-distance path loss model for distance estimation and Weighted Centroid Localization with a weight exponent be-tween 2.0 and 3.5 for position estimation.",

abstract = "Pressure and flow estimation in water distribution networks (WDNs) allows water management companies to optimize their control operations. For many years, mathematical simulation tools have been the most common approach to reconstructing an estimate of the WDNs hydraulics. However, pure physics-based simulations involve several challenges, for example, partially observable data, high uncertainty, and extensive manual calibration. Thus, data-driven approaches have gained traction to overcome such limitations. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling and graph neural networks (GNN), a data-driven approach, to address the pressure estimation problem. Our work has two main contributions. First, a training strategy that relies on random sensor placement making our GNN-based estimation model robust to unexpected sensor location changes. Second, a realistic evaluation protocol that considers real temporal patterns and noise injection to mimic the uncertainties intrinsic to real-world scenarios. As a result, a new state-of-the-art model, GAT with Residual Connections, for pressure estimation is available. Our model surpasses the performance of previous studies on several WDNs benchmarks, showing a reduction of absolute error of ≈40% on average.",

Since these technologies require specialized knowledge, the development of technological and methodological tools that allows its implementation is limited. Most of the current solutions are built on top of specific tools which require considerable effort to consolidate into an integral solution. Moreover, those tools work on specific domains, or they do not support some of the phases required for LOD life cycle (e.g., data cleaning, data exploitation). In this paper, we present a framework for LOD management which follows methodological principles presented in the state of the art in scientific literature and provides an unified software tool for publishing LOD for multiple domains and technologies. Our platform leverages a modular ETL processor, allowing a transparent and flexible integration, providing an integral environment for LOD.

Those models allow to extract complex translational-invariant features and to exploit the temporal dependencies from sensors' time series data. This work posits additional dependencies between sensors beyond the time dimension, such as physical proximity, which are equally important for the characterization of human activities. We leverage such spatial dependencies by modeling them as a graph. Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we learn global and local representations of the intra- and intersensor dependencies. We empirically show that by maximizing the mutual information between the local and global representations, the performance of the recognition models can be significantly improved. Our results show a clear improvement over previous works based on CNNs, LSTMs, Attention-based and other more complex GNNs-based architectures.
