% Please use the following STRICT format:
%
% @type{key,
%	title = "...",
%	abstract = "...",
%	author = "...",
%	year = "",
%	month = ,
%	day = "",
%	language = "English",
%	doi = "",
%	url = "",
%	pdf = "",
% }
%
% 1. For the key use the last name of the first author followed by the
%    year, a colon, and the acronym of the venue, all in lowercase,
%    e.g.: "lazovik2000:ictai".
% 2. For author and editor use the format "A. Lazovik and E. Lazovik".
% 3. The doi, url, and pdf fields are optional but adviced. For url,
%    use the research.rug.nl link unless otherwise provided.
% 4. The month and day fields are optional but adviced because they
%    are used to order our publications. Ordering happens by year,
%    then type, month, day, author. Entries without the month field
%    will appear below those with a month field. The same holds for
%    the day field.
% 5. The month field must be either a number, a lowercase three
%    letter month code, or a capitalized month WITHOUT quotation
%    marks, e.g.: 3 or mar or March.
% 6. Use all other required fields for the type of publication.
% 7. UTF-8 is supported, as well as SOME LaTeX escaped characters,
%    e.g.: G{\"a}rtner or Gärtner.
% 8. In case two group members co-author a publication and each
%    include it in their bib file, they MUST use the same entry with
%    the same EXACT key.

  title = {Correlating the Community Structure of Constraint Satisfaction Problems with Search Time},
  abstract = {A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is, in its most general form, an NP-complete problem. One of the several classes of tractable problems that exist contains all the problems with a restricted structure of the constraint scopes. This paper studies community structure, a particular type of restricted structure underpinning a class of tractable SAT problems with potentially similar relevance to CSPs. Using the modularity, it explores the community structure of a wide variety of problems with both academic and industrial relevance. Its impact on the search times of several general solvers, as well as one that uses tree-decomposition, is also analysed to determine whether constraint solvers exploit this type of structure. Nearly all CSP instances have a strong community structure, and those belonging to the same class have comparable modularity values. For the general solvers, strong correlations between the community structure and the search times are not apparent. A more definite correlation exists between the modularity and the search times of the tree-decomposition, suggesting that it might, in part, be able to take advantage of the community structure. However, combined with the relatively strong correlation between the modularity and the tree-width, it could also indicate a similarity between these two measures.},
