abstract = "Pressure and flow estimation in water distribution networks (WDNs) allows water management companies to optimize their control operations. For many years, mathematical simulation tools have been the most common approach to reconstructing an estimate of the WDNs hydraulics. However, pure physics-based simulations involve several challenges, for example, partially observable data, high uncertainty, and extensive manual calibration. Thus, data-driven approaches have gained traction to overcome such limitations. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling and graph neural networks (GNN), a data-driven approach, to address the pressure estimation problem. Our work has two main contributions. First, a training strategy that relies on random sensor placement making our GNN-based estimation model robust to unexpected sensor location changes. Second, a realistic evaluation protocol that considers real temporal patterns and noise injection to mimic the uncertainties intrinsic to real-world scenarios. As a result, a new state-of-the-art model, GAT with Residual Connections, for pressure estimation is available. Our model surpasses the performance of previous studies on several WDNs benchmarks, showing a reduction of absolute error of ≈40% on average.",

abstract = "Conventional digital twins (DT) for critical infrastructures are widely used to model and simulate the system’s state. But fundamental environment changes bring challenges for DT adaptation to new conditions, leading to a progressively decreasing correspondence of the DT to its physical counterpart. This paper introduces the DiTEC system, a Digital Twin for Evolutionary Changes in Water Distribution Networks (WDN). This framework combines novel techniques, including semantic rule learning, graph neural network-based state estimation, and adaptive model selection, to ensure that changes are adequately detected, processed and the DT is updated to the new state. The DiTEC system is tested on the Dutch Oosterbeek region WDN, with results showing the superiority of the approach compared to traditional methods.",

abstract = "Currently, the number of common benchmark datasets that researchers can use straight away for assessing data-driven deep learning approaches is very limited. Most studies provide data as configuration files. It is still up to each practitioner to follow a particular data generation method and run computationally intensive simulations to obtain usable data for model training and evaluation. In this work, we provide a collection of datasets that includes several small and medium size publicly available Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), including Anytown, Modena, Balerma, C-Town, D-Town, L-Town, Ky1, Ky6, Ky8, Ky10, and Ky13. In total 1,394,400 hours of WDNs data operating under normal conditions is made available to the community.",

abstract = "Privacy restrictions hinder the sharing of real-world Water Distribution Network (WDN) models, limiting the application of emerging data-driven machine learning, which typically requires extensive observations. To address this challenge, we propose the dataset DiTEC-WDN that comprises 36,000 unique scenarios simulated over either short-term (24 hours) or long-term (1 year) periods. We constructed this dataset using an automated pipeline that optimizes crucial parameters (e.g., pressure, flow rate, and demand patterns), facilitates large-scale simulations, and records discrete, synthetic but hydraulically realistic states under standard conditions via rule validation and post-hoc analysis. With a total of 228 million generated graph-based states, DiTEC-WDN can support a variety of machine-learning tasks, including graph-level, node-level, and link-level regression, as well as time-series forecasting. This contribution, released under a public license, encourages open scientific research in the critical water sector, eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive data, and fulfills the need for a large-scale water distribution network benchmark for study comparisons and scenario analysis.",
