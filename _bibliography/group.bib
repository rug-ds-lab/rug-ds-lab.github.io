  abstract  = "Data parallel processing is a key concept to increase the scalability and elasticity in event streaming systems. Often data parallelism is accomplished in a splitter-merger architecture where the splitter divides incoming streams into partitions and forwards them to parallel operator instances. The splitter performance is a limiting factor to the system throughput and the parallelization degree.This work studies how to leverage novel methods of in-network computing to accelerate the splitter functionality by implementing it as an in-network function. While dedicated hardware for in-network computing has a high potential to enhance the splitter performance, in-network programming models like the P4 language are also highly limited in their expressiveness to support corresponding parallelization models. We propose P4SS which supports overlapping and non-overlapping count-based windows for multiple independent data streams and parallelizes them to a dynamically configurable number of operator instances. We validate in the context of a prototypical implementation our splitting strategy and its scalability in terms of switch resource consumption.",

	ABSTRACT = {By virtue of the steady societal shift to the use of smart technologies built on the increasingly popular smart grid framework, we have noticed an increase in the need to analyze household electricity consumption at the individual level. In order to work efficiently, these technologies rely on load forecasting to optimize operations that are related to energy consumption (such as household appliance scheduling). This paper proposes a novel load forecasting method that utilizes a clustering step prior to the forecasting step to group together days that exhibit similar energy consumption patterns. Following that, we attempt to classify new days into pre-generated clusters by making use of the available context information (day of the week, month, predicted weather). Finally, using available historical data (with regard to energy consumption) alongside meteorological and temporal variables, we train a CNN-LSTM model on a per-cluster basis that specializes in forecasting based on the energy profiles present within each cluster. This method leads to improvements in forecasting performance (upwards of a 10% increase in mean absolute percentage error scores) and provides us with the added benefit of being able to easily highlight and extract information that allows us to identify which external variables have an effect on the energy consumption of any individual household.},

	abstract = { The problem of global optimal evaluation for multi-robot allocation has gained attention constantly, especially in a multi-objective environment, but most algorithms based on swarm intelligence are difficult to give a convergent result. For solving the problem, we established a Global Optimal Evaluation of Revenue method of multi-robot for multi-tasks based on the real textile combing production workshop, consumption, and different task characteristics of mobile robots. The Global Optimal Evaluation of Revenue method could traversal calculates the profit of each robot corresponding to different tasks with global traversal over a finite set, then an optimization result can be converged to the global optimal value avoiding the problem that individual optimization easy to fall into local optimal results. In the numerical simulation, for fixed set of multi-object and multi-task, we used different numbers of robots allocation operation. We then compared with other methods: Hungarian, the auction method, and the method based on game theory. The results showed that Global Optimal Evaluation of Revenue reduced the number of robots used by at least 17\%, and the delay time could be reduced by at least 16.23\%. }
